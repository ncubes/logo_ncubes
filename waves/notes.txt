scale is based on mostly overtone series of C = 512 (scientific pitch standard).
F or fa is based on the non-integer 4/3, not in the overtone series.
Try muting tracks as it plays to get chords you might recognize.

IMPORTANT:

reduce all notes to -30db.
Reduce do and do2 (both C notes) to -36db

Otherwise, you get a bad clipping.
