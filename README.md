MSWlogo version of n cube generation and display program
First, you will need to get a PC running Microsoft Windows.  Any old version will do.
Then, get the IDE for MSWlogo here: https://mswlogo.en.softonic.com/

Try some of the example programs given in the IDE.

The purpose of this repo is to publish a bunch of logo programs, a collection of them.
No one file depends on any other file.  Each is can be run by itself with the logo IDE.

Each uses the concept of a walk around the verticies of an ncube with no retrace to 
create art, such as music via midi files, or visual art.

Try some, create some!

This collection is now only the ncube related files.  The demo programs that are part of
MSWlogo have been deleted from this repo.

Issue: mswlogo help files do not work.  This can be fixed.  It is a usoft issue.
If you research you will find that you can augment your windows system to make it work.
I have done this on Windows 10 and 11.  You can too.
