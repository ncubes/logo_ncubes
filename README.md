MSWlogo version of n cube generation and display program
First, you will need to get a PC running Microsoft Windows.  Any old version will do.
Then, get the IDE for MSWlogo here: https://mswlogo.en.softonic.com/

Try some of the example programs given in the IDE.

The purpose of this repo is to publish a bunch of logo programs, a collection of them.
No one file depends on any other file.  Each is can be run by itself with the logo IDE.

Each uses the concept of a walk around the verticies of an ncube with no retrace to 
create art, such as music via midi files, or visual art.

Try some, create some!
